#PLAN:
# Read the QRCode with the Read-Data.py script.
# Then output that data to a table (1st column = itemname, 2nd column = number, 3rd column = in/out/broken) or .csv file
# create a app where you can create items, mark them in/out/broken, 

# App should always have a camera feed, then once a QRCode is found, have buttons for Mark in/out/broken &
